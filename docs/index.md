# CPSM & NA Profile Documentation
This is the Common Power System Model (CPSM) profile group documentation. CPSM is a Common Information Model (CIM) profile group that defines the
classes, class attributes, and associations from the CIM required to solve state estimation and power flow. Originally, it was developed to satisfy use cases related to bulk electric power transmission model exchange between Energy Management Systems.

The Common Power System Model (CPSM) profile group contains the following profiles (click on each to learn more):

- [Core Equipment](./Core Equipment/index.md)
- [Operation](./Operation/index.md)
- [Short Circuit](./Short Circuit/index.md)
- [State Variables](./State Variables/index.md)
- [Steady State Hypothesis](./Steady State Hypothesis/index.md)
- [Topology](./Topology/index.md)

[IEC 61970-452](https://webstore.iec.ch/en/publication/64844) is the IEC standards document for CPSM. Please refer to the standard for additional information on the profile.
