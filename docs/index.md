# Overview
This site provides online documentation corresponding to the CPSM and CPSM-NA profile sets made publically available by the UCAIug under the [Apache 2.0](LICENSE) open source license. The CPSM is specifically a set of Common Information Model (CIM) profiles that define the classes, class attributes, and associations from the CIM required to solve state estimation and power flow.  Complementary is the CPSM-NA profile set that defines the classes, class attributes, and roles from the CIM necessary to describe the result of state estimation, power flow and other similar applications that produce a steady-state solution of a power network. It is the [IEC 61968-452:2021](https://webstore.iec.ch/en/publication/64844) and [IEC 61968-456:2021](https://webstore.iec.ch/en/publication/68054) published standards that define the use cases and requisite detailed coverage, and should therefore be consulted for information pertinent to the data exchanges these profiles are to be used for. Both of these publications are available for purchase at the [IEC Webstore](https://webstore.iec.ch/).

The CPSM & CPSM-NA sets of profiles currently documented herein consist of the following (click on each to learn more):
