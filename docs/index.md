# Overview
This site contains documentation for the Common Power System Model (CPSM) and Network Analysis (NA) profile groups. CPSM is a Common Information Model (CIM) profile group that defines the classes, class attributes, and associations from the CIM required to solve state estimation and power flow. Originally, it was developed to satisfy use cases related to bulk electric power transmission model exchange between Energy Management Systems. NA is a CIM profile group

The Common Power System Model (CPSM) profile group contains the following profiles (click on each to learn more):

- [Core Equipment](./Core Equipment/index.md)
- [Operation](./Operation/index.md)
- [Short Circuit](./Short Circuit/index.md)
- [State Variables](./State Variables/index.md)
- [Steady State Hypothesis](./Steady State Hypothesis/index.md)
- [Topology](./Topology/index.md)

[IEC 61970-452](https://webstore.iec.ch/en/publication/64844) is the IEC standards document for Common Power System Model (CPSM). [IEC 61970-456](https://webstore.iec.ch/en/publication/68054) is the IEC standards document for Network Analysis (NA). Please refer to the standards for additional information on the profile.
