# Overview
This site provides online documentation corresponding to the profile artifacts made publically available by the UCAIug under the [Apache 2.0](LICENSE) open source license. 

This set of artifacts covers both the CPSM and CPSM-NA profile sets. The CPSM is a set of Common Information Model (CIM) profiles that define the classes, class attributes, and associations from the CIM required to solve state estimation and power flow, while the CPSM-NA set of profiles "rigorously defines the classes, class attributes, and roles from the CIM necessary to describe the result of state estimation, power flow and other similar applications that produce a steady-state solution of a power network, under a set of use cases." The [IEC 61968-452:2021](https://webstore.iec.ch/en/publication/64844) and [IEC 61968-456:2021](https://webstore.iec.ch/en/publication/68054) standards publications collectively define these usee cases and as such, should be referred to for the necessary detailed coverage pertinent to the data exchanges these profiles are utilized in. Both publications are available at the [IEC Webstore](https://webstore.iec.ch/).

The CPSM & CPSM-NA sets of profiles currently consists of the following (click on each to learn more):
