# Overview
This site provides online documentation corresponding to the Common Power System Model (CPSM) and Common Power System Model - Network Analysis (CPSM-NA) profile sets made publically available by the UCAIug under the [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) open source license. 

In particular, the CPSM is the set of Common Information Model (CIM) profiles that define the classes, class attributes, and associations from the CIM required to solve state estimation and power flow. Complementary to this is the CPSM-NA set of profiles which define the classes, class attributes, and roles from the CIM necessary to describe the result of state estimation, power flow and other similar applications that produce a steady-state solution of a power network. 

Currently documented herein are the following (click on each to learn more).

CPSM Profiles:

- [Core Equipment](./Core Equipment/index.md)
- [Operation](./Operation/index.md)
- [Short Circuit](./Short Circuit/index.md)
  
CPSM-NA Profiles:

- [State Variables](./State Variables/index.md)
- [Steady State Hypothesis](./Steady State Hypothesis/index.md)
- [Topology](./Topology/index.md)

Note that detailed use   case coverage for these profiles can be found in the [IEC 61970-452:2021](https://webstore.iec.ch/en/publication/64844) and [IEC 61970-456:2021](https://webstore.iec.ch/en/publication/68054) published standards. These publications should be consulted during implementation and are publicly available for purchase at the [IEC Webstore](https://webstore.iec.ch/).
